 ### AIM:
 To understand the standard procedure to interface an FPGA board and flashing method using usb blaster 
### HARDWARE REQUIRED:  â€“ PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   Quartus prime
### THEORY 
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

## Procedure 
Start the Quartus II Programmer.
